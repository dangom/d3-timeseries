#+TITLE: D3 (pulsar like) Timeseries

* Installation

Clone the repo and run =npm install=.
The code is pretty much a port to Node.js of the following Observable notebook: https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/psr-b1919-21
Except I use it to draw timeseries from ICA decompositions as seen in the figure below:

* Usage

Usage of this tool is not advised. Currently it only supports datasets with N rows x 10 columns, where numbers are separated by 2 spaces (the formatting of FSL Melodic). It should be straightforward to generalize the script to accept other sizes of data, and to generate meaningful x-axis from user inputs, but I didn't have the time to work on that.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node index.js --input melodic_mix --output melodic_mix.svg
